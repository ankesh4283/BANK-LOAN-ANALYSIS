# 🏦 Bank Loan Portfolio Risk & Performance Analytics

### End-to-End Excel + PostgreSQL + Power BI Business Intelligence Project

An advanced financial analytics project that transforms raw loan transaction data into strategic credit risk and portfolio performance insights.

This project demonstrates:

- Financial KPI engineering  
- Credit risk segmentation  
- Trend and growth analysis  
- Portfolio monitoring logic  
- Executive-level dashboard reporting

---

## 📌 Business Context

A lending institution requires structured visibility into:

- Portfolio health and repayment strength  
- Credit risk exposure  
- Funding vs recovery efficiency  
- Borrower segment performance  
- Month-over-month growth stability  

The objective was to build a reporting system that supports credit and portfolio decision-making.

## 📊 Executive Summary

Analyzed **38,576 loan records** across one lending cycle to evaluate portfolio performance and risk distribution.

### Key Portfolio Metrics

- 💰 **Total Funded Amount:** $435M  
- 💵 **Total Amount Received:** $473M  
- 📈 **Recovery Ratio:** 109%  
- ✅ **Performing Loans:** 86%  
- ⚠️ **Charged-Off Loans:** 14%  
- 📊 **Average Interest Rate:** 12.05%  
- 📉 **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI):** 13.3%  

### Core Insight

The portfolio shows strong repayment efficiency, with total recovery exceeding funded capital by approximately 9%, indicating stable cash flow and controlled credit exposure.

---

## 🛠 End-to-End Analytical Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation (Excel)

- Cleaned and validated raw loan dataset  
- Standardized loan status categories  
- Verified financial columns (loan amount, DTI, interest rate)  
- Structured date fields for time-based analysis  

Ensured data accuracy before KPI computation.

---

### 2️⃣ KPI & Risk Engineering (PostgreSQL)

Developed financial indicators using:

- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)  
- Conditional segmentation (CASE WHEN)  
- Time-based filtering for MTD and PMTD analysis  

Built metrics for:

- Portfolio capital deployment  
- Risk segmentation (Good vs Charged-Off loans)  
- Growth trend measurement  
- Recovery efficiency evaluation  

---

### 3️⃣ Executive Reporting (Power BI)

Designed a 3-layer dashboard system:

- **Executive Overview** – Portfolio KPIs and risk ratio  
- **Performance Trends** – Monthly funding vs recovery  
- **Risk Segmentation** – Loan grade, DTI, geography, purpose  

Built for management-level monitoring and decision support.

## 📈 Portfolio Intelligence & Insights

### 💰 Recovery Efficiency

- Total Recovery: $473M  
- Total Funded: $435M  
- Recovery Ratio: 109%  

The portfolio generates repayment beyond principal exposure, indicating strong collection and yield performance.

---

### ⚠️ Risk Concentration

- 14% of loans are charged off  
- Higher DTI segments show elevated default patterns  
- Certain loan grades carry disproportionate default exposure  

Credit risk is concentrated within specific borrower groups, allowing targeted mitigation instead of broad restrictions.

---

### 📊 Growth Stability

- Applications increased approximately 6–8% month-over-month  
- Funded growth did not significantly increase default levels  

Growth appears controlled and sustainable.

---

### 👥 Borrower Behavior Analysis

- 45%+ of loans are for debt consolidation  
- 36-month term loans dominate issuance  
- Longer employment tenure correlates with stronger repayment performance  

Employment stability acts as a key repayment driver.

---

### 🌍 Geographic Exposure

Top 3 states contribute over 30% of total funded capital, indicating moderate regional concentration risk.

---

## 💼 Strategic Recommendations

- Tighten underwriting criteria for high-DTI borrowers  
- Closely monitor loan grades with elevated charge-off clustering  
- Diversify geographic exposure to reduce regional dependency risk  
- Maintain growth discipline without relaxing credit standards  

---
